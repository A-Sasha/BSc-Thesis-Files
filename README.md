This is a collection of the main codes used for simulations of ring oscillator networks in LTspice and data processing codes in MATLAB.
In the LTspice directory the main simulational models can be found. 
In the MATLAB directory, the code for accessing the LeCroy ocsilloscope through the Instrument Control Toolbox, the dissipated energy calculation and the sound generation codes can be found.
